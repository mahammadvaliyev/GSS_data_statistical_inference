# Project description
Project aims to analyze General Social Survey (GSS) data, come up with a research question (hypothesis) of interest and perform a hypothesis test.

# Description of data
The General Social Survey (GSS) is a survey that is regularly collected since 1972 by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago. GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 80 years. Among the topics covered are civil liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, stress and traumatic events. It is one of the most influential studies in the social sciences, and is frequently referenced in leading publications.
